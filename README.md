## Usage

After cloning the repository, you should put your own `config.json` and `.env` files in the bot directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ACaccel/discord-bot-template.git
cd discord-bot-template
yarn install
yarn <bot-name>

# for voice record command
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains the bot's configuration settings. You can customize the bot's settings by modifying this example.

- `guilds`: Guilds that the bot has joined. Each guild has its own `channels` and `roles` objects. You can define any channel and role that you want to access in the code.
- `commands`: Define the commands that the bot will respond to. Remember to add the command name here if you create a new one.

```json
{
    "guilds": {
        "your-guild-id": {
            "channels": {
                "debug": "debug-channel-id",
            },
            "roles": {
                "admin": "admin-role-id",
            }
        },
        ...
    },
    "commands": [
        "help",
        "bug_report",
        "change_avatar",
        "talk",
        ...
    ],
    other custom configurations...
}
```

The `.env` file contains the bot's environment variables. It should have the following variables.

```env
TOKEN = YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URI
CLIENT_ID = YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_CLIENT_ID
PORT = LISTENING_PORT (if you want to run the bot as a web server)
```
